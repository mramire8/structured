And anyway, humans have the ability to disregard some of their instincts.   You are attaching too many things to the term "moral," I think. Let's try this:  is it "good" that animals of the same species don't kill each other.  Or, do you think this is right?   Or do you think that animals are machines, and that nothing they do is either right nor wrong?    Those weren't arbitrary killings.  They were slayings related to some sort of mating ritual or whatnot.   Yes it was, but I still don't understand your distinctions.  What do you mean by "consider?"  Can a small child be moral?  How about a gorilla?  A dolphin?  A platypus?  Where is the line drawn?  Does the being need to be self aware?  What *do* you call the mechanism which seems to prevent animals of the same species from (arbitrarily) killing each other?  Don't you find the fact that they don't at all significant?

225	0	0	    The argument goes as follows: Q-oid quotes appear in John, but not in the almost codified way they were in Matthew or Luke. However, they are considered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of Q as such, and not an entirely different source.       We are talking date of texts here, not the age of the authors. The usual explanation for the time order of Mark, Matthew and Luke does not consider their respective ages. It says Matthew has read the text of Mark, and Luke that of Matthew (and probably that of Mark).   As it is assumed that John knew the content of Luke's text. The evidence for that is not overwhelming, admittedly.       When they are from about 200, why do they shed doubt on the order on putting John after the rest of the three?       Sure, an original together with Id card of sender and receiver would be fine. So what's that supposed to say? Am I missing something?       That John was a disciple is not generally accepted. The style and language together with the theology are usually used as counterargument.   The argument that John was a disciple relies on the claim in the gospel of John itself. Is there any other evidence for it?   One step and one generation removed is bad even in our times. Compare that to reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies. Not even to speak off that believers are not necessarily the best sources.     In other words, one does not know what the original of Mark did look like and arguments based on Mark are pretty weak.

296	0	0	: You know, it just occurred to me today that this whole Christian thing : can be blamed solely on Mary. :  : So, she's married to Joseph.  She gets knocked up.  What do you think : ol' Joe will do if he finds she's been getting around?  So Mary comes up : with this ridiculous story about God making her pregnant.   :     Nice attempt Chris . . . verrry close.    You missed the conspiracy by 1 step. Joseph knew who knocked her up. He couldn't let it be known that somebody ELSE got ol' Mary prego. That wouldn't do well for his popularity in the local circles. So what  happened is that she was feeling guilty, he was feeling embarrassed, and THEY decided to improve both of their images on what could have otherwise been the downfall for both. Clever indeed. Come to think of it . . . I have gained a new respect for the couple. Maybe Joseph and Mary should receive all of the praise being paid to jesus.

430	0	0	Is it just me, or has this part gotten beyond useful?  Gregg is not, as I understand his posts, giving any support to the bounty on Rushdie's life.  If that's correct, end of one point...  Gregg is using the concept of legal in a way most Westerners don't accept. His comments about Islamic Law I think make a great deal of sense to him, and are even making a _little_ sense to me now - if a person is a member of a group (religion or whatever) they bind themselves to follow the ways of the group within the bounds of what the group requires as a minimum. The big bone of contention here that I'm picking up is that in the West we have secular governments that maintain, more or less, a level of control and of requirements outside the requirements of optional groups.  I think the majority of us reading this thread are in tune (note - I didn't say "in agreement") with the idea that you are finally responsible to the secular government,  and within that to the group or groups a person may have chosen.  With that in mind, it not possible under secular law ("legally" as most people would define the term) to hold a person to a particular group once they decide to separate from it.  Only if the secular authorities agree that there is a requirement of some sort (contractual, etc) is there any secular _enforcement_ allowed by a group to a group member or past group member.  A religion can, and often does, believe in and require additional duties of a group member.  And it can enforce the fulfillment of those duties in many ways - ostracism is common for example.  But the limit comes when the enforcement would impose unwanted and/or unaccepted onus on a person _in conflict with secular law_.  This is the difference.  In a theocracy, the requirements of the secular authorities are, by definition, congruent with the religious authorities. Outside a theocracy, this is not _necessarily_ true.  Religious requirements _may_ coincide or may not.  Similiarly, religious consequences _may_ or may not coincide with secular consequences (if any).  Regards,  Dew
245	0	0	 Well, I could use the argument that some here use about "nature" and claim that you cannot have superhuman powers because you are a human; superhuman powers are beyond what a human has, and since you are a human, any powers you have are not beyond those of a human.  Hence, you cannot have superhuman powers.  Sound good to you?  Anyway, to the evidence question: it depends on the context.  In this group, since you are posting from a american college site, I'm willing to take it as given that you have a pair of blue jeans.  And, assuming there is some coherency in your position, I will take it as a given that you do not have superhuman powers.  Arguments are evidence in themselves, in some respects.   Yep.   Good.   "Extra" evidence?  Why don't we start with evidence at all?  I cannot see any evidence for the V. B. which the cynics in this group would ever accept.  As for the second, it is the foundation of the religion. Anyone who claims to have seen the risen Jesus (back in the 40 day period) is a believer, and therefore is discounted by those in this group; since these are all ancients anyway, one again to choose to dismiss the whole thing.  The third is as much a metaphysical relationship as anything else-- even those who agree to it have argued at length over what it *means*, so again I don't see how evidence is possible.  I thus interpret the "extraordinary claims" claim as a statement that the speaker will not accept *any* evidence on the matter.
754	0	0	 Of course B.M. is not incorrect.  He is defending Islam.  When defending Islam against infidels you can say anything and no one will dare criticize you.  But when an atheist uses the same argument he is using "petty sarcasm".  So B.M. can have his "temporary atheists" whenever he needs them and all the "temporary atheists" can later say that they were always good Muslims because they never explicitly rejected Islam.

144	0	0	Stuff deleted  All five schools of law (to the best of my knowledge) support the death sentence for apostasy WHEN it is accompanied by open, persistent, and aggravated hostility to Islam. Otherwise I agree, there is no legal support for punishment of disbelief. The Qur'an makes it clear that belief is a matter of conscience. Public or private disavowal of Islam or conversion to another faith is not punishable (there are some jurists who have gone against this trend and insisted that apostasy is punishable (even by death) - but historically they are the exception.  Cursing and Insulting the Prophets falls under the category of "Shatim". 
418	0	0	 What do you mean by omnipotent here?  Do you mean by "omnipotent" that God should be able to do anything/everything?  This creates a self-contradictory definition of omnipotence which is effectively useless.  To be descriptive, omnipotence must mean "being all-powerful" and not "being able to do anything/everything".  Let me illustrate by analogy. Suppose the United States were the only nuclear power on earth.  Suppose further that the US military could not effectively be countered by any nation or group of nations.  The US has the power to go into any country at any time for any reason to straighten things out as the leaders of the US see fit.  The US would be militarily "omnipotent".  But suppose further that the US holds to a doctrine/philosophy of not interfering in the internal affairs of any nation, such as the current civil war in the former Yugoslavian states.  Technically (in this scenario) the US would have the power to  unilaterally go into Yugoslavia and straighten out the mess.  But effectively the US could not intervene without violating its own policy  of non-interference.  If the policy of non-interference were held to strongly enough, then there would never be a question that it would ever be violated.  Effectively, the US would be limited in what it could actually do, although it had the power to do "whatever it wanted". The US would simply "never want to interfere" for such an idea would be beyond the consideration of its leaders given such an inviolate non-interference policy.  God is effectively limited in the same sense.  He is all powerful, but He cannot use His power in a way that would violate the essence of what He, Himself is.  I hope this helps to clear up some of the misunderstanding concerning omnipotence.  Regards,

359	0	0	  ( in <1993Apr16.163729.867@batman.bmd.trw.com> )   ( responding to Dave "First With Official A.A Nickname" Fuller )   [ ... ]  That means that it is an effective anti-recidivism measure.  It does not say that it deters an individual from committing a capital crime in the first place.  The true question is whether the threat of death is likely to actually stop one from murdering.  (Or commiting treason -- are there any other capital crimes anywhere in the USA?)  That is, if there were no death penalty, would its introduction deter a would-be criminal from committing her/his crime?  I doubt it.  This is only the first step.  Even if it were a strong deterrent (short of being a complete deterrent) I would reject it.  For what about the case of the innocent executed?  And even if we could eliminate this possibility, I would reject the death penalty as immoral. This makes me something of a radical on the issue, although I think there are many opponents of captial punishment who agree with me, but who find the innocent executed the strongest argument to make.  I would, if magically placed in charge, facilitate state-aided suicide for criminals who have life-sentences.  This could be a replacement for capital punishment.  Those who don't want to live the rest of their lives in jail would always have this option.

338	0	0	      I think many reading this group would also benefit by knowing how deviant the view _as I've articulated it above_ (which may not be the true view of Khomeini) is from the basic principles of Islam.  So that the non-muslim readers of this group will see how far from  the simple basics of Islam such views are on the face of them. And  if they are _not_ in contradiction with the basics of Islam, how  subtle such issues are and how it seems sects exist in Islam while  they are explicitly proscribed by the Qur'an.     In my opinion considering any human being as having a substance or metaphysical fundamentally different from that of any other human being _is_ a heretical notion and one proscribed by Islam.      Absolutely! I would be interested in discussing this privately and I am interested in hearing how one might try to make the concept of error-free and sinless human beings philosophically consistent with the teachings of the Qur'an. However, _prima facie_ such attemptsa are highly susceptible to degenerating into monkery, explicitly proscribed by the Qur'an.    Alaikum Wassalam

758	0	0	      I agree fully with the above statement and is *precisely* what I meant by my previous statements about Islam not being anarchist and the law not being _enforcible_ despite the _law_ being applicable.      I disagree with this conclusion about the _applicability_ of the  Islamic law to all muslims, wherever they may be. The above conclusion  does not strictly follow from the foregoing, but only the conclusion  that the fatwa cannot be *enforced* according to Islamic law. However,  I do agree that the punishment cannot be applied to Rushdie even *were* it well founded.    Certainly putting a price on the head of Rushdie in Britain is a criminal  act according to Islamic law.     Yes.

372	0	0	  Well, that's the question, isn't it?  The goals are probably not all that obvious.  We can set up a few goals, like happiness and liberty and the golden rule, etc.  But these goals aren't inherent.  They have to be defined before an objective system is possible.   It is not too difficult, one you have goals in mind, and absolute knoweldge of everyone's intent, etc.   Omniscience is fine, as long as information is not given away.  Isn't this the resolution of the free will problem?  An interactive omniscient being changes the situation.   Well, I was speaking about an objective system in general.  I didn't mention a specific goal, which would be necessary to determine the morality of an action.

68	1	1	  It is true that Mormons believe that all spirits (including Jesus, Lucifer, Robert Weiss) are in the same family.  It does not mean that Jesus was created, but rather that Lucifer and Robert Weiss were not.  I agree that this is a "heresy".  So what?   The sweating of blood in Gethsemene is not a basic Mormon doctrine.  Jesus did not perform the atonement in Getheseme alone, as some anti-Mormons are trying to teach.   As far as the "unpardonable sin" whatever that is, it is Biblical, and not specifically Mormon.  It is also called the sin against the Holy Ghost.  Most Bible scholars (other than conservative ones) do not believe Jehovah and Elohim were always the same. I'm sure you've heard of the J and the E texts?  I don't know what you mean by "That He needed to be saved".  Jesus? Jehovah?  Elohim?  In Mormon doctrine, Jesus was sinless, and thus did not "need to be saved".     --  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | "Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon."

168	1	1	 Looking at [1] we find that during Roman times "Tyre vied with Sidon for first place in the intellectual life of the period"; that Tyre was the seat of a Christian bishop, eventually with 14 dioceses under it; that "the most magnificent church of its kind in all Phoenecia" was the basilica built in Tyre ca. 314; that Tyre was well known for its exports of glassware, wine, white marble, and dyed cloth; that Tyre, along with other seaports, "provided outlets for South Arabian, Indian and even Chinese trade"; that Tyre had to accomodate its growing population by "following a perpendicular, rather than horizontal, line of growth" (because it was running out of land to build on); that Tyre established colonies of its own.  None of this sounds like a "small fishing village" by any stretch of the imagination.  Centuries later, under the Abbasids, Tyre had "opulent and flourishing bazaars" and buildings of 5-6 stories.  During this period, Tyre was "noted for its export of sugar, beads, and, as of old, glassware." During the Crusades, Tyre was the second-most flourishing city held by Franks.  (There is a lot more, but I got tired of writing.)  In [2] we read the following description of modern Lebanon: "other *major cities* in Lebanon include Tripoli, Sidon, Tyre, Baalbek and Zahlah."  [my emphasis]  This source also discusses the impact of the Lebanese Civil War, and the Israeli military actions (1978, 1982) on the trading ports of Tyre and Sidon.  It notes that after Israel's withdrawel in 1984, "Tyre appeared to enjoy a revival of its local economy."  If Tyre is such an insignificant little fishing village at present, why is it always called a city (or, above, a "major city")?  Why does it show up on all the maps?   When population figures for cities in Lebanon are given, why is Tyre always one of the cities on the list (even if the list is only a dozen cities long)?  [1] Philip K. Hitti, _Lebanon in History: From the earliest times to the present_, NY, St. Martins, 1967.    [2] Federal Research Division, Library of Congress, _Lebanon: a country study_, edited by Thomas Collelo, 1989.   A one-horse town?  Sounds like a lot of work for one horse. (Anyway, Tyre is connected by roads to the mainland.  They may even use cars these days. :-)   The 1991 Encyclopedia Britannica says "Pop. (1982 est.) 23,000."   Most other references give figures in the 14-17 thousand range. (One atlas gives the population of Tyre as 60,000; the same source give comparatively high figures for Sidon and Beirut, also, so I doubt that it is a typo.  Perhaps these were figures for the cities and their surrounding areas.)  I don't doubt that the population of Tyre has fluctuated over the last few decades.  In particular, the 1982 Israeli military action hurt Tyre quite a bit.      I thought you were talking about times that Tyre was destroyed. Don't most, if not all, of these apply not just to Tyre but to  the other cities in the area?  Sidon, for example?  Can you make a case for Tyre having been singled out?   They had a good deal of autonomy under the Seleucids. From [2]: Tyre "receiv[ed] the rights [of autonomy] from Antiochus Ephiphanes and from 125 BC onward enjoy[ed] complete autonomy. She started a large series of coins, occasionally in gold ..."  The descriptions of Tyre under the Romans don't seem to fit your characterization, either.  And under the Abbasids it seems to have been allowed to flourish.  I still think you are stretching when you try to describe Tyre as having been nothing but a small fishing village.   A Christian apologist whose standards of scholarship are quite low. He happens to quote the same source you quote (Nina Jidejian, _Tyre through the Ages_, Beirut, Dar El-Mashreq Publishers, 1969). The same sentence, in fact.  He defends the fulfillment of the prophecy using the same argument you are using, an argument that I haven't seen in print anywhere else, which is why I jumped to the conclusion that you were quoting Josh.  (I tried to find the Jidejian book, but it isn't listed in Books in Print.  Can you tell me more about it? Her descriptions are so much at odds with everything else I've read; I'm curious to know why.)
592	1	1	Tony-  While I honestly believe you believe you are doing a "good thing" by posting that piece of propaganda, I believe the more people believe that the more they will feel justified in their blatant persecution of gay oriented people.  I have seen the film called "The Gay Agenda" and along with my church we found it to be horrifying.  Not because of what was actually shown (cleaver use of editting can create any image one wants to portray), rather becaseu we are familia familiar with how widely it was actively distributed and how many naive people are actually believing the garbage found within it.  The truth is that neither you nor I can fully speak for anyone who calls themself gay, but knowing as many as I do and knowing their testimonies and witnessing thier faith and life I have to say that the report you posted is a very biased report, something obviously claimed against gays as well.  The truth is that unless YOU are innately gay you cannot know what harm you are causing.  I speak as an abolitionist who supports affirming gay rights in our society.  I do not support wild sex or any other misrepresentations perpetrated by Christian Fundamentalist extremists, but I know people who are not the sexual deviants your report paints them to be.  It is no mistake that the APA removed homosexuality from it's list of mental illnesses, it is also no mistake that there are many Christians and homophobes who long to bring it back to the list. I do not feel threatened by gays, I don't understand why others are.  The following is an article concerning two of the more popular ex-gay min- istries:  Exodus International & Homosexuals Anonymous.  THE FOUNDER OF AN "EX-GAY" SUPPORT GROUP CHOOSES HOMO OVER HETERO  by Robert Pela (from Gay oriented magazine ADVOCATE)  In December 1985, David Caligiuri received one of The Advocate's homophobia rewaa awards: the A Prayer A Day Keeps the Lust Away citation.  As director of FREE INDEED, a national ex-gay ministry, Caligiuri was singled out for offering discontented gays and lesbians "a way out of the homosexual death-style" through prayer.  "I'd like to give the award back," Caligiuri now laughs, "I'm no longer deserve it."   Caligiuri's eight year involvement with the national "ex-gay" movement peaked with his founding of the Phoenix chapter of Homosexuals Anonymous (HA) as well as Free Indeed.  He has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the ex- gay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception.  "There's no reality in it," he says, "I was selling a product, and my product was a lie."   Headed up by national ministries like Exodus International and Courage, the organizations of the ex-gay movement rely on the tenents of born-again Christianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals -- usually young gay men who are just coming out -- that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing their sexual urges and embracing Christianity.  "We offer support to people who are seeking to leave the sin of homosexuality," explains Bob Davies, director of Exodus.  He ventures that "about 80% of those seeking to abandon their homo- sexuality are men."   "Anybody who is involved in the ex-gay ministry is misguided and is wasting their time," says Lisa Seeley, a former "redeemed lesbian" who worked with Caligiuri as HA and appeared with him on the Sally Jessy Raphael show.  "These organizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded."   "It's possible to change your identity or your behavior," says sex educator Brian McNaught, author of _On Being Gay_. "But it's really impossible to change your orientation.  These people are no longer calling themselves gay, but they continue to have same-sex erotic feelings."   Caligiuri says he founded Free Indeed after an ominous week in 1981 when all hell broke loose in his personal life.  A few days after his lover ended both their romance and their business partnership, Caligiuri was sexually assaulted by a man he picked up in a bar.  "I was really drunk," he recalls, "and I went home with this guy.  He tied me up and raped me.  He left me tied up all night, and the next morning he raped me again."   When Caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker, he returned home to the home he shared with his ex-lover.  "He had another man there with him," Caligiuri recalls.  "I thought at this time, 'If this is what being gay is about, I don't want to be this way anymore."   Caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out, he would share his discovery with others.  He organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at Phoenix's gay pride parade in June 1985, and a few months later Free Indeed held its first public protest.  At a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance, Free Indeed members loudly blasted gays, telling them ther were sinners headed for hell.   Free Indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week, thanks in part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages.  "We were listed under Lesbian and Gay Alternative Services," Caligiuri says, "so people thought we were a gay information switchboard.  People would call to find out where the local bars were, and we'd preach to them about the sins of homo- sexuality."  Ruses like this are typical of the movement, Caligiuri says, adding, "They'll do anything to reach these people."   "David used to go on radio and say really stupid things," recalls Peter Kelly, a counselor at Phoenix's Catholic diocese AIDS program, "like that he knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors."   Caligiuri's family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on Raphael's syndicated talk show in 1985.  "They were relieved," he recalls. "They figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family, better that I should be a 'reformed' gay person."   But Caligiuri was hardly reformed.  "By the time I appeared on Sally's show," "I'd started having sex with men again.  Men would call our hotline and tell me about thier latest sin: sex with their pastor, sex with their father.  I was horny all the time."   Unable to risk going to gay bars, where he might be recognized from his numerous television appearances, Caligiuri says he "used to go to bookstores and get blowjobs."  When he wasn't working the bookstores, he was sleeping with other "reformed" homosexuals.   "I didn't realize it at first, but a lot of the HA leaders were having sex with one another," Caligiuri says.  "We'd go to conferences in other cities, and we'd be paired up in hotel rooms.  Everybody was sleeping with everybody else."   By the time he appeared on 'AM Philadelphia' television show in May 1988, Caligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week.  When the show's host asked him if he ever "acted on temptation," his answer was a lie.   Caligiuri's duplicity began to take it's toll on him, however.  He was suffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis, a dibilitating yeast infection, and this led to his escape from the sect.  "I was too sick to go to church," he explains.  "The more time I spent away from those people the more I began to feel like myself.  I began to remember who I used to be."   Late in 1991, Caligiuri turned Free Indeed phone lines over to a local church and closed the ministry's doors.  "I'd convinced myself that there is no need in the world for ex-gay people," he says.   Today, Caligiuri, 31, is studying alternative spiritualities ("I'm interest- ed in belief systems that aren't judgemental."), considering romance ("But not with a CHristian!"), and searching for a new project to devote himself to. "I feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes," he says.  "I want to eventually stop feeling guilty about what I did and make up for the damage I may have brought to our community."  ---end article---  Caligiuri's tory is by no means unique and I have read several other articles of former leaders and founders of 'ex-gay' ministries who have said very similar th similar things.  Fortuantely not all of them have left Christianity, but have come to realize that God loves them despite the attitudes of others.  Some, like Chris Glaser, director of the Presbyterian "Lazarus Project" of West Hollywood Presbyterian Church have actually been working with the gay community to bring them into the sheepfold of Christ and encouraging real ethical values of sexuality within the sphere of being gay.  I have also, as I said talked and become and become close friends with many who once attended such groups as "Love In Action" and others, who either once claimed to have been "reformed" or who were too honest with themselves to live a lie, no matter who was disappointed in them.  Some were even encouraged to marry as a way of "sealing" their new heterosexuality, only to eventually start hitting the bars, bathhouses and bookstores, since these were usually activities under the concealment of night and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous "sin" through a committed relationship.  This is a horrible trap which the CHurch has dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people, and the very inno- cent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages.  Yet the church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allow gay people: 1) heterosexuality or 2) celebacy.  This is sad.  What is also mrtifying, is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires and fear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces on them, they may even opt for 'suicide' or surgical dampering of the brain functions.  In the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common- place.  There are now becoming available more and more literature on the threat of coercive Christianity toward gays, such as Sylvia Pennington's _"Ex-Gays?  There Are None_. and others.  There are also a great many fact based books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such as Maury Johnston's _Gays Under Grace_, and Chris Glaser's _Come Hom!_.  I seriously recommend those for people seeking help for this persecution and self-acceptance.
165	1	1	  Brian K., guess what?  You missed the point.  On a scale from cold to hot, you are at 0 degrees Kelvin.   Then as you understand it, what is it?   Yes.  I agree with that.  But what does that have to do with Jesus? Punishment you say?  Jesus did not regard his death as punishment.    Good.  I wouldn't either--not the way you understand it.     Ask Jesus himself.  He himself said why in John 12:23-32.  It isn't a mystery to anyone and there certainly is no need for a persuasive argument.   Read Jesus's own reply to your question.  Jesus gives more reasons in John 16:7.  But one obvious reason why Jesus died, (and as with everything else, it has nothing do with his punishment) was that he could rise to life again--so that we would "stop doubting and believe" (John 21:27).  The fact that Jesus rose from the dead is my hope that I too will rise from the dead.  It is an obvious point.  Do not overlook it. Without this obvious point, I would have no hope and my faith would be vanity.  Why did Jesus suffer in his death?  Again, ask Jesus.  Jesus says why in John 15:18-25.   That's no mystery either.  "The world hates him without reason."  It is a direct proclamation of how far we humans botch things up and thus, how much we need a Saviour.

782	1	1	Tony-  I read your post, it was nothing new, I had seen much the same in other typical"Christian" anti-gay sentimental literature.  Gay people are and will con- tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates.  You may be unaware of all the statistica "findings" concerning African-Americans that have been published and used by various groups to re-enforce their own bias against African-Americans.  We usually think of the KKK in these instances, but there are many other groups.  Of course, the vast majority of the public scoff at such findings and documents today, but that was not always the case. Fortunately African-Americans had "whites" who supported their 'cause' and public sentiment was eventually (if not entirely) turned around.  There was even a Civil War, and anti-negro sentiment increased.  In fact, until laws were put in place to protect the inalienable rights of Blacks it was pretty much legal to discriminate against them.  I know many gays and I will NOT turn my back on them or their right to be free form discrimination.  You may think that I have been deceived or something, that is your perogative.  My church, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) openly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society, including gays.  We believe the Gospel message of preaching to all creation and making disciples.  We believe in the Lord's great commandment to Love, and we beleive in standing up for the oppressed, even if it is not popular to do so.  I really like my church for last reason the most.  I can find a church almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the Gospel and believes in the commandment of Love (though I'm hard-pressed to find many who actually sho Love), but not many are willing to champion the oppressed, especially within their own community.  I may have lost face with the greater Christian community for the unpopularity of my beliefs, but so did the abolitionists against the oppression of African-Americans.  Many were even killed and treated as runaway slaves for being "nigger-lovers" and such.  I guess I've decided the challenge is worth it.  In my talks with gay men and women I have heard tragic story after tragic story centering around failed marriages, wives and husbands who are straight who have been hurt in the process, etc.  Funny thing is, I don't know of one case where the parents, ex-wives, or even children have continued to reject their gay family member (son, daughter, ex-husband, father, etc.) after they began to take part in some form of support group, like PFLAG.  I'm apalled by the legislation which passed in Colorado, and am equally out0 raged that such slimey people as Louis Sheldon (from the Tradition Values Coalition) have been actively working in the Christian underground to garner support within several (8 I believe) states this coming November for more oppressive legisation against gays.  Perhaps you don't get it, and maybe you never will.  Many didn't get it in the Middle Ages and the proclaimed God's will be done as they massacred thousands in witch hunts and inquisitions.  The message that comes through, loud and clear, by proponents against gay rights and against gays in general, is that there is a strong dislike, even hatred for gays, whether you want to call it such or not (it doesn't change the results).  The major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end, the final effect of posts like that of yours and Mr. Hudson is that YOU have a "conditional" love for gays.  Condition:  Change and we'll love you. This is sure strange coming from a group who claim that God has an "unconditional" love, one that calls people "just as they are."  Sure there are things that will 'naturally' change, and habits (like alcoholism, wife beating, etc.) that need to be changed through some sort of therapy.  But then there are things like left-handedness, etc. that no amount of beating it out of people, is going to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to "other people's expectations." In the process this coerced conformity causes many people a great deal of harm, especially when it is caused by people who have nothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about their own sense of pseuper-spirituality.  This is sad, but I thoroughly believe that one day it will change.  It may be unpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do with something very personal like 'sexuality' (a taboo subject even today), but I firmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulation on thier bedrooms.  It's funny that most straight people have successfully removed restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation, but we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression...as though it helps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society. Gay people are not criminals.  Another interesting thing happened recently.  A very prominent charismatic church in the Silicon Valley (here) had two of it's pastors arrested for self- admitted charges of pederasty (men having sex with boys).  This had apparently been going on for some time (a couple years?), but since the charges were voluntary, and the church worked closely with the police, so I imagine that was how they managed to downplay it in the media.  How could such a thing happen when the church, itself, has an ex-gay ministry?  One of my friends recently told me he was "approached" by someone who is going through the reparitive therapy there, and he was thoroughly convinced that the request for dinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry.  These are difficult times we live in, but providing hostile environments and creating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is not the call of the Christian community.  The results of the passing amendment in Colorado has created an organization who's posters are appearing all over Colorado called "S.T.R.A.I.G.H.T." (I forget the whole definition off hand, but the last part was Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash) and their motto is "Working for a fag-free America" with an implicit advocation for violence.  This is sick, and it seems to be what you and Mr. Hudson, and others are embracing.  We Christians have a LOOOOOOOOOONG tradition of coersion and oppression towards those we feel don't 'measure up', and constant beratement from organizations like The Christian Research Institute, while they do have a good purpose also, their major work seems to be finding new and better ways of excluding people.  The Gospel I believe is not so negative, rather it seeks ways to "include" people.  I have several of Dr. Martin's books and find them quite helpful, especially concerning 'cults.' But it seems that CRI, has become a cult unto itself.  Why don't we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people to Jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away?  Whatever

676	1	1	 No.  There are two problems here:  (1) Peter died two millenia ago.  The original letters he wrote have long since decayed into dust.  If he were alive today and I could question him, then this might lend credibility to your claims (but probably not much, because after all, I've heard people claim with all sincerity that they've spoken with Elvis recently).  But after his death, Peter's writings were transcribed by monks for centuries, and I find it hard to believe that one of them somewhere didn't decide to change the wording of something to make it (in his opinion) a little easier to understand.  (2) Even if Peter did witness the miracles of Jesus two millenia ago, that doesn't mean that your deity is what the Bible says it is (God might just be Satan, trying to convince everyone that he's a nice guy), or even that your deity is still alive and active in the world today.  Nice try, but it just isn't enough to convince me, especially since your wild claims about your deity seem to fly in the face of the way I've observed the world to work.  Please find something more compelling.

641	1	1	 Where does it say in the bible that Christians are supposed to persecute Jews?  Isn't it love your enemies instead?  They may say they are "Christian" but do their actions speak differently?  Do you believe what everyone tells you?  I don't.  I came to believe in God by my own investigation and conclusions. And ultimately by my own choice.  Salvation, however, was granted only through the grace of God.   To be a Christian is to model oneself after Jesus Christ as implied by the very name Christian.  If you say you believe in your head but do not feel in your heart, what does that say of your belief?   White supremists and Neo-Nazis are NOT any brand of Christian.  "If you hate your whom you can see then how can you love God whom you cannot  see?"  What does this belief entail?  Believing in Christ and having your sins forgiven in His name does NOT give a Christian a free licence to sin.  To repent of a sin is to ask forgiveness of that sin and TRY NOT to do it again.  I am a Christian, but if you lump me in with racists and accuse me of being such, then are you not pre-judging me?  BTW, I am of Chinese racial background and I know what it is to be part of a visible minority in this country.  I don't think that I would be favourably looked upon by these White supremist "Christians" as you call them.  Anyone can say what they believe, but if they don't practice what they preach, then their belief is false.  Do you concur?    Nazis and racists in general are the ones that come to my immediate attention. What I believe is that such people may be using the bible to mask their racial intolerance and bigotry.  They can do as they do and hide behind Christianity but I tell you that Jesus would have nothing to do with them.   No arguement there.   The only point I'm trying to make is that those who call themselves Christian may not be Christian.  I ask that you draw your own conclusions by what they do and what they say.  If they are not modelled after the example of Jesus Christ then they are NOT Christian.  If they have not repented of their sins and accepted Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Saviour then they are  NOT Christian.  These are the only criteria to being a Christian.  May God be with you,
81	1	1	  Brian K., I am pleased with your honesty.  And to be honest as well, I believe you have not asked my god to come to you.  Why do I say this? Because by the things you write on the net, and the manner with which you write them, you show me that you made up your own god and are attempting to pass him off as the real thing.  I got news for you. Yours doesn't at all sound like mine.  Your god doesn't come to you because your god doesn't exist.   I am sorry Brian, but when I read your postings, I do not see an open mind. What I do see is misunderstanding, lack of knowledge, arrogance and mockery.   Be true to yourself then.  Have an open mind.  And so end the mockery.  Gain  knowledge of the real God.  Put your presumptions aside.  Read the Bible and know that there is, truly is, a reason for everything and there exists a God that has so much love for you that the depth of it goes beyond our shallow worldly experience.  A person who commits himself   to seeking God, will find God.  Jesus stands at your door and knocks.  But a person who half-heartedly opens the Bible, or opens it with purpose to find  something to mock, will find, learn and see nothing.  The only thing one will gain with that attitude is folly.  Be careful to not jump the gun, for at first glance, there are many passages in the Bible that will seem bizarre and absurd.  Be assured that even though they seem alien at first, be confident that they are not. Be assured that beyond your present comprehension, there lies such deep reasons that once you see them, you will indeed be satisfied.  I will personally guarantee that one.  As Jesus put it, "You will never be thirsty again.  Your cup will even flow over."   From King Solomon (970 B.C. to 930 B.C.):      "It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;      to search out a matter is the glory of kings."   Jesus says in John 6:44 & 55:     "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him."   And in John 3:16:     "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,    that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal    life."   You are included in "whosoever".  And I also pray that the Father is drawing you, which it seems He is doing else you wouldn't be posting to talk.religion.misc.  Remember Brian, you could be a St. Paul in the making.  Paul not only mocked Christians as you do, but also had pleasure stoning them.  Yet God showed him mercy, saved him, and Paul became on of the most celebrated men in the history of God's church.  You see Brian, I myself better be careful and not judge you, because you could indeed be the next Paul.  For with the fervor that you attack Christians,  one day you might find yourself one, and like Paul, proclaim the good news of Jesus with that very same fervor or more.  Or you could be the next Peter.  What Jesus said to Peter, Jesus would  probably say to you: "Satan would surely like to have you."  Why so? Because Peter was hard-headed, cynical and demonstrated great moments of stupidity, but once Peter committed himself to a task he did with full heart.  Peter was the only apostle to have the faith to walk on water as Jesus did.  You asked "Why not believe in Zeus?"  Zeus didn't offer eternal life. You got nothing to gain by believing in Zeus.

It had many elements that seem to have been borrowed by Catholicism (e.g. the Mass, communion, the sharing of a sacred meal, consecration of bread and wine, etc.)  For quite an amusing novel that uses this same idea, check out:  The Covenant of the Flame by David Morrell.  It has some quite interesting occult bits, and lots of killing. I won't spoil it by revealing the ending, but I will say that it is relevant to Mithraism.
45	0	1	 : The Bible says there is a God; if that is true then our atheism is : mistaken.  What of it?  Seems pretty obvious to me.  Socrates said : there were many gods; if that is true then your monotheism (and our : atheism) is mistaken, even if Socrates never existed.   Jim,  I think you must have come in late. The discussion (on my part at least) began with Benedikt's questioning of the historical acuuracy of the NT. I was making the point that, if the same standards are used to validate secular history that are used here to discredit NT history, then virtually nothing is known of the first century.  You seem to be saying that the Bible -cannot- be true because it speaks of the existence of God as it it were a fact. Your objection has nothing to do with history, it is merely another statement of atheism.

Gosh, there's a heck of a lot of stuff that I  believe that COULD be wrong, and that comes from sources that COULD be wrong.  What do you base your belief on atheism on?  Your knowledge and reasoning?  COuldn't that be wrong?  MAC -- ****************************************************************                                                     Michael A.
