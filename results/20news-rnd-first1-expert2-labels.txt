There is Nothing But Glorifies His (ALLAH's) Praise.  In The Name Of  Allah, The Compassionate, The Merciful     "He is who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth  to make it supreme over all religion:  and sufficient is Allah as a Witness.  Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and those who are with him are firm against the unbelievers and merciful among each other.  You will see them bowing and prostrating  themselves, seeking Allah's grace and His pleasure.  Their mark is on their face the sing of prostrafion; this is their similitude in the Torah and Indgil." [the Our'an 48:28-29]     Since the Nineteenth and Thirhy-first Words concerning the mission of Muhammad (SAW) prove his prophethood with decisive evidences, we assign the verification of that subject to those Words.    As a supplement to them, we will merely show here in Nineteen Signs, some  of the flashes of that great truth.     FIRST SIGN:  The Owner and Master of this universe does everything with knowledge, disposes every affair with wisdom, directs everything all-seeingly, treats everything all-knowingly, and arranges in everything with His will and wisdom such causes, purposes and uses that are apparent to us.  Since the One who creates knows, surely the One who knows will speak, since He will speak, surely He will speak to those who have consciousness, thought, and speech.  Since He will speak to those who have thought, surely He will speak to humankind, whose make-up and awareness are more comprehensive of all conscious beings.  Since He will speak to humankind, surely He will speak to the most perfect of mankind and those most worthy of address and highest in morality, and who are qualified to guide humanity; then He will certainly speak to Muhammad (SAW),  who, as friend and foe alike testify, is of the highest  character and morality, and who is obeyed by one fifth of humanity, to whose spiritual rule half of the globe has submitted, with the radiance of whose light has been illumined the future of mankind for thirteen centuries, to whom the believers, the luminous segment of humanity, renew their oath of allegiance five times a day, for whose happiness and peace they pray, for whom they call down Allah's blessings and bear admiration and love in their hearts.     Certainly, He will speak to Muhammad (SAW), and Indeed He has done so;  He will make him the Messenger, and Indeed He has done so; He will make him the guide for the rest of humanity, and Indeed He has done so.

They could still be considered true Muslims, and you can't judge them, because this is something between God and the person.  You have to apply your rule as well with atheists/agnostics, you don't know their belief, this is something between them and God.  So why the hoopla about Khomeini not being a real Muslim, and the hoopla about atheists being not real human beings?  Cheers, Kent
