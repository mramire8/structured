In <lsran6INN14a@exodus.Eng.Sun.COM> emarsh@hernes-sun.Eng.Sun.COM (Eric             Huh?  Please explain.  Is there a problem because I based my morality on  something that COULD be wrong?  Gosh, there's a heck of a lot of stuff that I  believe that COULD be wrong, and that comes from sources that COULD be wrong.  What do you base your belief on atheism on?  Your knowledge and reasoning?  COuldn't that be wrong?  MAC -- ****************************************************************                                                     Michael A.

It had many elements that seem to have been borrowed by Catholicism (e.g. the Mass, communion, the sharing of a sacred meal, consecration of bread and wine, etc.)  For quite an amusing novel that uses this same idea, check out:  The Covenant of the Flame by David Morrell.  It has some quite interesting occult bits, and lots of killing. I won't spoil it by revealing the ending, but I will say that it is relevant to Mithraism.

As Hemingway said, my imitators always imitate the _bad_ aspects of my writing. Hoban would, no doubt, say the same here.

What of it?  Seems pretty obvious to me.  Socrates said : there were many gods; if that is true then your monotheism (and our : atheism) is mistaken, even if Socrates never existed.   Jim,  I think you must have come in late. The discussion (on my part at least) began with Benedikt's questioning of the historical acuuracy of the NT. I was making the point that, if the same standards are used to validate secular history that are used here to discredit NT history, then virtually nothing is known of the first century.  You seem to be saying that the Bible -cannot- be true because it speaks of the existence of God as it it were a fact. Your objection has nothing to do with history, it is merely another statement of atheism.
